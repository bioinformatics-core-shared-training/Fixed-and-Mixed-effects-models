## Linear modeling: Hands-on with Fixed and Mixed effects models
 
## Objective

This course aims to introduce linear regression models with fixed and random effects. 
Regression model assumptions, diagnostics and model-building strategies are showed. 
Remedies for violated assumptions are explained. This course provides hands-on training 
with R software.


## Course overview

### 1. Effects and statistical regression models

- define and classify...
  + effects
  + statistical regression models
  + linear regression models.

### 2. Linear models with only fixed effects

* develop, check and fit the following regression models in R:
  + One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
  + Two-way ANOVA without interaction
  + Two-way ANOVA with interaction
  + Linear regression models
  + Multivariable regression models with fixed effects.

- develop and identify 'reference' statistical models in R.

### 3. Linear mixed-effects models

- develop, check and fit linear mixed-effects regression models in R.
- tumour growth curve analysis is used as pivotal application of linear mixed-effects 
regression models in preclinical cancer research.


## Prerequisites

**This course assumes basic knowledge of statistics and use of R** , which would be obtained from our Introductory Statistics Course and an 
"Introduction to R for Solving Biological Problems" run at the Genetics department (or equivalent).
